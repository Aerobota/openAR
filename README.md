				OpenAR - OpenCV Augmented Reality
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenAR is a very simple C++ implementation to achieve Marker based Augmented Reality. OpenAR is based on 
OpenCV and solely dependent on the library. OpenAR decodes markers in a frame of image. OpenAR does not 
implement Marker tracking across frames. Also OpenAR does not implement Template matching for Marker decoding.
